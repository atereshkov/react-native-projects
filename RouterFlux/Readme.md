## React Native Router Flux (Navigation between scenes)

[React-native-router-flux](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux) is a routing package that allows you to:

* Define scene transitions in one central location
* Without having to pass navigator objects around, and allow you to
* Call transitions anywhere in your code with a simple syntax (e.g. Actions.login({username, password}) or Actions.profile({profile}) or even Actions.profile(123) - all params will be part of this.props for given Scene component).
